Please meet our official [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images available at the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/sourcemage/).

All you need to do is:

```
docker pull sourcemage
```

or specifically:

```
docker pull sourcemage:0.61
```

and start using [the magic](/Intro)!


These images are based on our official [chroot images](/Install/Chroot) stripped off unneeded stuff for container virtualization environment.
