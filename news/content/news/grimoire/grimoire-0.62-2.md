Stable grimoire version 0.62-2 has been released!

This is mostly a security update accumulated a lot of security fixes including those for Mozilla stuff, Xorg libraries, Nginx, NTP and OpenSSL/LibreSSL.  
It also contains more corrections for 0.61 â†’ 0.62 upgrading path, as well as a brand new [Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org) **4.0** (thanks to Ladislav "lace" Hagara for it).

The update also introduces our fresh [castfs](/castfs) [0.6.2](/news/castfs-0-6-2/) released recently, and as you may have noticed [Sorcery](/Sorcery) **1.15.4** released several days ago includes one important fix for multiple triggers of a spell, so the recommended update procedure is:

1. `sorcery update`
2. `scribe update stable` (if you're running stable grimoire)
3. `cast -c castfs`
4. `sorcery upgrade`

I'd like to thank Thomas Orgis (sobukus) for helping with this update hard. Really hard.

The tarballs have been signed and uploaded to our server and will be propogating out to the mirrors within six hours.

To download the grimoire manually, get <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable.tar.bz2> or specifically <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable-0.62.tar.bz2>.

GPG signatures are available at <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable.tar.bz2.asc> or <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable-0.62.tar.bz2.asc>.
