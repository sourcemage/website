Stable grimoire version 0.6 has been released! Users of stable merely need to run `sorcery system-update`. Spells listed on the [release page](/Grimoire/stable/0.6) were tested and qualified to have no known defects of "gating" severity at the time of this release.

Many thanks and a virtual round of applause to everyone on the team. We all put forth the effort on this and made it happen in three weeks time. I think thats quite an accomplishment and something to be proud of. Great job everyone.

To download the grimoire manually, see <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable.tar.bz2> or <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable-0.6.tar.bz2>.
