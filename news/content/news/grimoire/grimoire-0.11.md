Stable grimoire version 0.11 has been released! Users of stable merely need to run `sorcery system-update`. Spells listed on the [release page](/Grimoire/stable/0.11) were tested and qualified to have no known defects of "gating" severity at the time of this release.

To download the grimoire manually, see <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable.tar.bz2> or <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable-0.11.tar.bz2>.

GPG signatures are available at <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable.tar.bz2.asc> or <http://codex.sourcemage.org/stable-0.11.tar.bz2.asc>.

I would like to thank Juuso Alasuutari, George Sherwood, Thomas Orgis, and Jaka Kranjc for their help on this release.
