Since [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) switched to production mode several months ago, it's a great opportunity for us to join in.

After more than **10,000,000** certificates already active this fall, our own has been issued for the following hosts:

* <https://sourcemage.org>
* <https://www.sourcemage.org>
* <https://bugs.sourcemage.org>

It will be renewed every 2 months with the corresponding SSL-termination service reloaded to reflect the update.

We're also thinking about HTTPS version of <http://static.sourcemage.org>, but not sure how critical it is for now and how much content we'll be going to have there.
